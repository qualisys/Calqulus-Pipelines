# A pipeline is written in YAML and instructs the Calqulus processing engine what to calculate.
# In order to process this pipeline, skeleton must be solved in QTM first.

# A pipeline consists of any number of base nodes defined on the root level. 

# Output nodes define an end result that is exported to the global scope and exported in the resulting JSON file.
# Output node can be 'event' or 'parameter'
# The main difference between the parameter and event is what type of data is stored. 
# A parameter node will store series and scalar data, whereas an event node will store event data.

# Space node defines custom coordinate systems. It is useful when orientation of subject changes
# with regards to the global coordinate system, e.g. walking through lab in both directions.

# Order of nodes is not important. They can be placed anywhere in YAML file.

############
## SPACES ##
############

# Create a space named VirtualLab, that is defined by the orientation of Hips (Pelvis) segment.
- space: VirtualLab
  alignWithSegment:
    segment: Hips

############
## EVENTS ##
############

# An event node defines steps used to calculate an event.
# An event is a label that describes one or more points in time.
# Events can be used in both event and parameter calculations, as well as for normalization by the reporting framework. 
# The resulting event is exported to the global scope and exported in the resulting JSON file.

# Create event at left knee maximum flexion
- event: BOF
  steps:
    - import: [0]
  
- event: EOF
  steps:
    - import: [$length]
  

- event: Left_knee_flex_max
  set: left # Used to specify which set the exported parameter will use. In most cases, this will be either left or right.
  steps:
    - max: Left Knee Angles.x
#    - peakFinder: Left Knee Angles.x # To do calculation on x component of the signal, select the component by adding '.x'
#    - eventMask: [$prev, BOF, EOF]
