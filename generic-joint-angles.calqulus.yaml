# A pipeline is written in YAML and instructs the Calqulus processing engine what to calculate.
# In order to process this pipeline, skeleton must be solved in QTM first.

# A pipeline consists of any number of base nodes defined on the root level. 

# Output nodes define an end result that is exported to the global scope and exported in the resulting JSON file.
# Output node can be 'event' or 'parameter'
# The main difference between the parameter and event is what type of data is stored. 
# A parameter node will store series and scalar data, whereas an event node will store event data.

# Space node defines custom coordinate systems. It is useful when orientation of subject changes
# with regards to the global coordinate system, e.g. walking through lab in both directions.

# Order of nodes is not important. They can be placed anywhere in YAML file.
